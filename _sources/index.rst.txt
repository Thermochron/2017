Low-temperature thermochronology is a geochronological method based on the temperature-sensitive retention of a radiogenically produced daughter product in mineral crystals.
It is widely used to quantify long-term rates of tectonic and erosional processes in mountainous regions, but can also be applied to study erosional processes in ancient settings.
In this course you will learn the fundamental concepts of thermochronology and its applications, be introduced to common mineral dating systems by European experts in thermochronology, and work with numerical tools for analyzing and interpreting thermochronometer data.

Course goals
------------
This course aims to:

1. Introduce the basic concepts of thermochronology and thermal processes in the crust
2. Provide an in-depth view into the systematics of popular thermochronometer systems, including (U-Th)/He, fission-track, and :sup:`40`\ Ar/:sup:`39`\ Ar dating in a variety of minerals
3. Support lecture-based knowledge with computational exercises from simple equations in Excel to sophisticated 3D thermal modelling

Target audience
---------------
Doctoral students (Master’s students will be considered if space is available)
