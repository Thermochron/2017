Software installation
=====================
To make things easy on the students and instructors we will be using a virtual machine environment for computing in the course.
This means that you will be doing all of the computational parts of the course on a Linux machine running on your own computer.
That Linux machine will be pre-configured with all of the software needed in the course.
In order to use that machine, you will need to do a few things.
