Software installation
=====================
To make things easy on the students and instructors we will be using a virtual machine environment for computing in the course.
This means that you will be doing all of the computational parts of the course on a Linux machine running on your own computer.
That Linux machine will be pre-configured with all of the software needed in the course.
In order to use that machine, you will need to do a few things.

Installing VirtualBox
---------------------

1. Download and install a copy of `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`__.
2. Download and install a copy of the `VirtualBox Extension Pack <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`__.

Installing the Linux image
--------------------------
You can download a copy of the virtual machine image from `https://filesender.funet.fi/?vid=3335246a-97c3-afc8-abd1-00005db02c43 <https://filesender.funet.fi/?vid=3335246a-97c3-afc8-abd1-00005db02c43>`__.
This image can be opened using VirtualBox and will allow you to run a Linux machine on your own personal computer.
All of the course software is available in this environment.

In case you need them, the username and passwords for the virtual machine images are below:

- Username: osboxes
- Password: Thermochron2017!

Software used in the course
---------------------------
If you use the Linux image above, you do not need to download and install any of the software below, as it is already installed and ready for use on the virtual machine.
If you would like to install the course software on your personal computer, for instance, you'll find a list of software and download links below.

- `HeFTy (version 1.7.4) <ftp://ftp.ctlab.geo.utexas.edu/Ketcham/ft/HeFTy/>`__ (Windows)
- `Flojt <http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/flojt/>`__ (Windows)
- `Pecube <https://github.com/HUGG/Pecube-HUGG>`__ (any operating system; needs compilers)
