Introduction to Pecube
======================  

Outline
-------

- General overview of Pecube and how it differs from the other models we've used
  
  - 3D heat transfer model (conduction, advection, material properties, topography, kinematics, etc.)
  - Age prediction algorithms (comparison to Dodson)
  - Differences from DiffArg (Crystal scale model of Ar diffusion with a specified thermal history)
  - Differences from HeFTy (Modeling ages data again, focussed only on the effect of the cooling history - no connection to physical process)
  - Aims of software
  - Advantages and disadvantages

- Using Pecube

  - Overview of the input file (quick, simple pre-configured example)
  - Running Pecube (test, run)
  - Post processing output
  - Visualizing output in ParaView

- Comparison with data

  - Thermal field (general structure, heat flow)
  - Age comparison (goodness-of-fit, 

- Designing your own models

  - Preparing a model, what do we need? (Ages, topography, material properties)
  - General design principles (spatial extent, model thickness, boundary conditions, etc.)
  - Optimization

- Pecube models of various scenarios

  - Changes in relief
  - Active faults

- Advanced topics

  - Data inversion using Pecube
